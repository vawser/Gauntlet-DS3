# Plan
#------------------------------
- Random starting location
- No central hub, rather each area will have a hub-like area, probably a bonfire that provides leveling and attunement.
- No warping (other than in-map warps for shortcuts).
- World is balanced so it is essentially equal, the tough areas will be a little bit tougher but not massive like the jump normally is.
- No weapon customization at all, if you pick up a weapon it is ready. Rather all power gain is via leveling or other effects from items.
- Randomisation of some aspects like enemies, merchants, etc.
- Each boss will drop something that you'll need to face Soul of Cinder. This replaces the Lords of Cinder, and forces you to face every boss. All the bosses will be at a equal stat power level (obviously mechanics will still make some easier than others).
- For spells, I'm thinking about a strictly cooldown system, so a spell will block you from casting for X seconds. The lowest spells won't have any cooldown. Basically FP will be removed.
- Estus, probably change to grass type system instead, so you need to find the healing stuff via killing enemies.
- Covenant slot: difficulty selection (increase enemy difficulty, gain more souls/item discovery)

# TODO
- Remove all unessential NPCs and enable NG+/COA enemies (or remove).
- Place central bonfires for each map, disable all others
 - Setup the bonfire talks
- Collate player points/spawnpoints for the random start placement
- Adjust weapon scaling for new design

# FIX
- Sort out the player respawn behavior (appears to be a specific spawnpoint for each map when homeward, dead may be the bonfire one).
